# Tic Tac Toe with Opponent

## Description
This is a simple two-player (player vs. opponent) Tic Tac Toe game written in Python. The game board is a 3x3 grid and players take turns marking a space with their respective symbol ("X" or "O"). The game ends when a player gets three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), or if all spaces on the board are filled without either player winning.

## How to play
To play the game, simply run the `main.py` file in a Python environment or from the command line.
